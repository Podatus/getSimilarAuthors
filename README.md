I gather here some codes I have made for managing data about scholar publications, like authors names, DOIs, authors affiliations, documents types etc.

language : [Processing](https://processing.org/) 

## General tutorial
1. download and launch Processing
2. In Processing save a new blank project
3. copy one code, and paste it in Processing
4. personnalize code (eg. paths, name or number of structures ...)
5. run code
6. see the result (usually a table in csv format) in the folder of the project (ctl+k)
