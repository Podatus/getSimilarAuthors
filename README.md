I gather and share here some useful codes I have made dealing with data in scholarly communication, like authors duplication, DOIs identification, documents types etc.  

language used is  [Processing](https://processing.org/) OR Python

## General tutorial
1. download and launch Processing
2. Create and save a new project
3. copy one code, and paste it in Processing
4. personnalize code (eg. paths, name or number of structures ...)
5. run code
6. see the result (basically a table in csv format) in the folder of the project (ctl+k)
